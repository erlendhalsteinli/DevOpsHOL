## Course Pre-requisites ##
If you are taking the Avanade DevOps Practitioners course, then the following are pre-requisites for the beginning of the course.  The pre-requisites are straightforward but a few of the tasks take some time so doing this before the class will save time during the course and allow you to get the maxium value from the class.

## Avanade DevOps HOL ##
These are the Hands On Labs (HOLs) associated with the Avanade DevOps Practitioners course.  This is based to a large part on the [PartsUnlimitedHOL](https://github.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimited/blob/master/README.md) but simplified to use the Visual Studio MVC sample application.  It does not use the PartsUnlimited HOL, but we want to acknowledge that project's contribution to this project.
